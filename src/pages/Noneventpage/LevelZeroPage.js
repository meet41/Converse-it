            <h3 className='logo3'>First Game – Trust me not</h3>
            <p>Objective: Identify the Joker among the players and avoid being deceived.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The game starts with a total of 10 players.</li>
              <li>Each player has a sticker on their back that displays a symbol (hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades), but they cannot see their own symbol.</li>
              <li>The game is played over multiple rounds.</li>
              <li>At the end of each round, players must guess their own symbol. If they guess correctly, they survive; if not, they are eliminated.</li>
              <li>One player is secretly assigned the role of the Joker, whose goal is to deceive others into making wrong guesses.</li>
              <li>The last three players or those who eliminate the Joker advance to the next game.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className='logo3'>Second Game – Luck or no luck</h3>
            <p>Objective: Outthink the other players in a complex game of averages.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each player chooses a number from 0 to 100 in each round.</li>
              <li>The target number is calculated as 0.8 multiplied by the average of all chosen numbers.</li>
              <li>Player whose number is closest to the target number wins, while others lose points.</li>
              <li>The game continues over several rounds with new rules added after each elimination.</li>
            </ul>
